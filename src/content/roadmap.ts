/**
 * Development roadmap.
 *
 * This deliberately did NOT carry over most of `sites/mcc-cal-vite/src/data/roadmap-data.ts`.
 * That file was a photography-business roadmap: service launches, client portals, marketplace
 * plans, and a set of AI features. None of it belongs in a technical publication, and the
 * vaguer entries ("Global expansion planning", "Maintain the highest quality standards")
 * are exactly the kind of claim this site is built to avoid.
 *
 * What survived is the software work that actually happened or is actually queued.
